\noindent {\bf PROCEDURE:} \\
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Decay Chain Simulation Setup}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Define the decay rates and times for each isotope transition based on given data.
      \item Create a computational model to simulate the decay of 20,000 atoms through the entire chain.
    \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Energy Release Calculation}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Calculate the number of atoms remaining for each isotope after decay at specific time intervals.
      \item Compute the energy released per decay event for $\alpha$, $\beta$, R, and Z decays using relevant equations.
      \item Accumulate and analyze the total energy released from each decay type.
    \end{itemize}
  
  \item \textbf{Shielding Thickness Calculation}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Utilize the average and standard deviation of $\alpha$-particle decay energies obtained from multiple simulation runs.
      \item Apply a safety margin (up to 3 standard deviations) to determine the maximum energy scenario.
      \item Calculate the shielding thickness required using the given blocking capability per cm of shielding material.
    \end{itemize}

\noindent {\bf ANALYSIS (and math):} \\

\subsection*{Decay Chain Simulation and Energy Release}
Implemented a simulation to track decay, calculating remaining atoms and energy release from different decay processes.

\subsection*{Average and Standard Deviation Calculation}
Performed multiple simulation runs to obtain average and standard deviation of total and individual decay energies produced.

\subsection*{Shielding Thickness Determination}
Derived the shielding thickness required to block $\alpha$-particle decay energy for safety, factoring in average energy and standard deviation.

\begin{equation*}
    \text{Average Energy Released} = \frac{\sum \text{Total Energy}}{\text{Number of Runs}}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    \text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (\text{Energy} - \text{Average Energy})^2}{\text{Number of Runs}}}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
    A_x = \int_{n-1}^{n+10} f(x) \mathrm{d}x
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
    F = ma \\
    = m \frac{dv}{dt} 
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \prod_{j\ge0}\left( \sum_{k\ge0} a_{jk}z^k \right) = \sum_{n\ge0} z^n 
    \left( \sum_{k_0,k_1\ldots\ge0 \atop k_0+k_1\cdots=0} a_{0k_0} a_{1k_1}\ldots \right)
